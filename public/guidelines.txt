### Wound Assessment Guidelines

The TIME framework is used for comprehensive wound assessment and guides appropriate management strategies to promote healing. Below is a detailed summary of the TIME framework and specific dressing selection, including example products recommended by the guideline:

TIME Framework
T - Tissue Management:

Ensure the removal of non-viable or necrotic tissue using appropriate debridement techniques such as:
Sharp debridement: Scalpel or scissors.
Autolytic debridement: Hydrogel dressings or hydrocolloids.
Enzymatic debridement: Proteolytic enzyme preparations.
Mechanical debridement: Wet-to-dry dressings or wound irrigation.
I - Infection/Inflammation Control:

If infection is present, consider using dressings with antimicrobial properties:
Silver-containing dressings (e.g., Acticoat, Aquacel Ag).
Iodine-containing dressings (e.g., Inadine, Iodosorb).
PHMB-containing dressings (e.g., Kerlix AMD).
For heavily colonised or malodorous wounds, use activated charcoal dressings (e.g., Carboflex).
Systemic antibiotics should be considered if signs of spreading infection are observed.
M - Moisture Balance:

Maintain an optimal moisture level by selecting dressings based on exudate levels:
Dry wounds: Hydrogel sheets or amorphous gels (e.g., Solugel, Intrasite Gel).
Low to moderate exudate: Hydrocolloids (e.g., Duoderm, Comfeel).
Moderate to high exudate: Foam dressings (e.g., Allevyn, Biatain, Mepilex).
High exudate:
Alginate dressings (e.g., Kaltostat, Sorbsan).
Hydrocellular foam (e.g., Aquacel Extra, Tielle).
Over-granulating wounds: Consider applying a foam dressing with light pressure.
If the wound shows signs of maceration (over-moisture), change to more absorbent dressings or increase dressing change frequency.
E - Edge of Wound:

Evaluate for undermining or rolled wound edges (epibole). If present:
Use a hydrocolloid or foam dressing to promote epithelialisation.
Consider adjunct therapies such as negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) if edges fail to advance.
Dressing Selection Guidelines
Below is a detailed list of dressing types and example products for various wound conditions:

Hydrogel Dressings:

Products: Solugel, Intrasite Gel, Purilon Gel.
Indications: For dry wounds or wounds requiring autolytic debridement.
Hydrocolloids:

Products: Duoderm, Comfeel, Replicare.
Indications: For low to moderate exudate wounds; promotes moist healing.
Foam Dressings:

Products: Allevyn, Biatain, Mepilex, Polymem.
Indications: For moderate to high exudate wounds; protects granulating tissue.
Alginate Dressings:

Products: Kaltostat, Sorbsan, Algisite M.
Indications: For high exudate wounds; provides haemostatic effect.
Hydrofibre Dressings:

Products: Aquacel Extra, Aquacel Ag.
Indications: For moderate to high exudate wounds, especially those at risk of infection.
Silver-containing Dressings:

Products: Acticoat, Aquacel Ag, Mepilex Ag.
Indications: For infected or high-risk wounds; antimicrobial properties.
Iodine-containing Dressings:

Products: Inadine, Iodosorb, Iodoflex.
Indications: For infected wounds; antimicrobial and absorbent.
PHMB-containing Dressings:

Products: Kerlix AMD, Suprasorb X + PHMB.
Indications: For colonised wounds or those at high risk of infection.
Charcoal Dressings:

Products: Carboflex, Actisorb.
Indications: For malodorous wounds; absorbs odour and bacteria.
Negative Pressure Wound Therapy (NPWT):

Products: VAC systems (e.g., VAC Ulta, PICO NPWT).
Indications: For chronic, complex, or slow-healing wounds.
Instructions for Wound Analysis Output
Instruct ChatGPT to use the TIME framework when generating wound analysis. The output should include:

Tissue Management: Describe the tissue status (e.g., necrotic, granulating) and recommend appropriate debridement techniques or dressings.
Infection/Inflammation Control: Assess for signs of infection and suggest antimicrobial dressings if necessary.
Moisture Balance: Evaluate moisture levels and recommend dressings based on exudate levels, using specific product examples where applicable.
Edge of Wound: Examine the wound edges and suggest measures to promote closure or correct abnormalities.
Additionally, dressing recommendations should be specific, and the analysis should explicitly reference the products listed in this guideline when relevant. Ensure concise formatting to minimise token usage while maintaining clarity.
