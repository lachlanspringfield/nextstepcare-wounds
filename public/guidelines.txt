### Wound Assessment Guidelines

1. Wound Bed Assessment
- Evaluate tissue type (granulation, slough, necrotic)
- Note wound bed color and consistency
- Identify signs of infection

2. Wound Measurements
- Measure length, width, and depth
- Document wound edges and periwound condition
- Track changes from previous assessments

3. Exudate Management
- Assess amount (none, light, moderate, heavy)
- Note color and consistency
- Evaluate odor presence

4. Pain Assessment
- Document patient-reported pain levels
- Note timing of pain (constant, during dressing changes)
- Assess impact on daily activities

5. Infection Prevention
- Monitor for signs of infection
- Document temperature of surrounding tissue
- Note presence of biofilm

6. Healing Progress
- Track epithelialization
- Document granulation tissue development
- Monitor wound edge advancement
